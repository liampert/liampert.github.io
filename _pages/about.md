Welcome to my website. I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University and a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.

My research interest primarily focused on racial and ethnic minority representation in Congress and unelected bureaucratic bodies, racial coalitions, and race/ethnic politics broadly. I am also working within broader American institutional research, with work in progress focusing on presidential nominations, Senate confirmation, committee demographic composition, etc. 

The website is still a work in progress!
