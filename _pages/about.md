Shalom! I am a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University and a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.

My research interest primarily focused on racial minority representation in Congress, racial coalitions, and race/ethnic politics broadly.

The website is still a work in progress!
